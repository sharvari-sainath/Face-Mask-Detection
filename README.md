# Face-Mask-Detection
Overview
This project is a Face Mask Detection System that identifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real time. It is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), OpenCV, and Flask for deployment.

 Technologies Used
Python 

TensorFlow/Keras (CNN Model) 

OpenCV 

Flask (Web Deployment) 
How It Works
The CNN model is trained to classify Masked and No Mask images.

OpenCV is used to detect faces from the webcam in real time.

The Flask web app displays the detection results on a simple UI.
